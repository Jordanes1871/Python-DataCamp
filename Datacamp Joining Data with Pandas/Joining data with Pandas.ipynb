To try for yourself, you have been given two tables with a list of actors from two popular movies: Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2. Most of the actors played in both movies. Use an outer join to find actors who did not act in both movies.\n",

    "Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. You have been given a table called crews, which has columns id, job, and name. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director.\n",

You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the sequels table and not all the rows of financials table need to be included in the result. From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset."

The frequency of the series are different, the GDP values are quarterly, and the population is yearly. Use the forward fill feature to fill in the missing data. Depending on the order provided, the fill forward will use unintended data to fill in the missing values."

You pull your price logs for three banks, JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank Of America (BAC). You want to know how the price change of the two other banks compare to JP Morgan. Therefore, you will need to merge these three logs into one table. Afterward, you will use the pandas .diff() method to compute the price change over time. Finally, plot the price changes so you can review your analysis.\n"

You have been given gdp, which is a table of quarterly GDP values of the US during the 1980s. Additionally, the table recession has been given to you. It holds the starting date of every US recession since 1980, and the date when the recession was declared to be over. Use merge_asof() to merge the tables and create a status flag if a quarter was during a recession. Finally, to check your work, plot the data in a bar chart."

Unfortunately, this wide format makes it difficult to plot this information over time. In this exercise, you will reshape a table of US unemployment rate data from the BLS into a form you can plot using .melt(). You will need to add a date column to the table and sort by it to plot the data correctly.\n",

    "It is widespread knowledge that the price of bonds is inversely related to the price of stocks. In this last exercise, you'll review many of the topics in this chapter to confirm this. You have been given a table of percent change of the US 10-year treasury bond price. It is in a wide format where there is a separate column for each year. You will need to use the .melt() method to reshape this table.\n",
